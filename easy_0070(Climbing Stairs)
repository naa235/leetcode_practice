You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 1, b = 1, sum;
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
            sum = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = sum;
        }
        return b;
    }
};
斐波那契数列的应用，但是我们将爬0层台阶的方法设置为1种。
