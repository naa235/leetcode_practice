You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int l=0;
        int r=height.size()-1;
        int max=0;
        while(l<r){
            int num=height[l]>height[r]?height[r]*(r-l):height[l]*(r-l);
            if(num>max)max=num;
            if(height[l]>height[r])r--;
            else l++;
        }
        return max;
    }
};
