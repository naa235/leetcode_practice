Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int single = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            single ^= num;
        }
        return single;
    }
};
